    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",

    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",

    "2. Context: additional information to help with performance\n",
    "3. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "4. Output indicator: How you prime the model to output what you want, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" and the end of a prompt can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf). You can also write \"Output:\" to prime the model to just write the output and nothing else.\n",
