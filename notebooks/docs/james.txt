James is a tall, athletic man in his early thirties, with a cheerful disposition 
that lights up the room. Born and raised in the bustling city of San Francisco,
 he made the unlikely transition to rural life when he adopted an energetic Border Collie named Laddie. 
 The duo is often spotted trekking the hilly terrain, with James capturing the beauty of nature through his lens. 
 James is a professional wildlife photographer, and he considers Laddie not just his pet, but his partner. The collaboration of this man and his dog have led to some of the most breathtaking shots that perfectly encapsulate the spirit of the wilderness.
