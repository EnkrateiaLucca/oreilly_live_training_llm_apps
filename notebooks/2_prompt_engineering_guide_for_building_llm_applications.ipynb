    "# Prompting Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is a piece of text that conveys to a LLM what the user wants. What the user wants can be many things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asking a question\n",
    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",
    "1. Task description: where you describe what you want\n",
    "2. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "3. Context information: background info on what you are requesting, the data you are providing etc...\n",
    "4. Prompt style: its how you ask the thing to the model and that can greatly influence its performance, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prompts can also be seen as a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM.](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2302.11382#:~:text=prompts%20are%20also%20a%20form%20of%20programming%20that%20can%20customize%20the%20outputs%20and%20interactions%20with%20an%20llm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way I like to think about prompts, is as tools that rearrange the weights (probabilities) in the LLM text representation space, to allow you access to a particular sub-universe within the embedding space of the LLM. \n",

    "Input: Glasses always fog up.\n",
    "Knowledge: Condensation occurs on eyeglass lenses when water vapor from your sweat, breath, and ambient humidity lands on a cold surface, cools, and then changes into tiny drops of liquid, forming a film that you see as fog. Your lenses will be relatively cool compared to your breath, especially when the outside air is cold.\n",

      "Best Response: Sure! Genetic mutations are changes that can happen in our DNA, which is like the instruction manual for our bodies. Just imagine if you had a recipe that told you how to make cookies. If there was a mistake or change in the recipe, it might lead to different or unexpected results.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same thing can happen with our DNA. Sometimes, small changes or mistakes can happen when cells copy their DNA, like a typo in a sentence. These changes are called mutations. They can happen for lots of reasons, like exposure to certain chemicals or radiation, or they can even be passed down from our parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the time, these mutations don't cause any problems and our bodies can still function normally. But sometimes, mutations can lead to changes in how our bodies work or develop. These changes can be harmless or they can cause health conditions or diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to remember that not all mutations are bad. In fact, some mutations can be helpful or even provide an advantage in certain situations, like helping us fight off diseases or adapt to new environments. Researchers study genetic mutations to learn more about how our bodies work and how to treat and prevent diseases.\n",
      "------\n",
      "Worst Response: Genetic mutations are changes that can occur in our DNA. Our DNA is like an instruction manual that tells our cells how to grow and function. Sometimes, mistakes can happen when our DNA is being copied or when our cells are dividing. These mistakes can result in genetic mutations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic mutations can be caused by a variety of factors, such as exposure to harmful chemicals or radiation, or they can simply happen by chance. Some mutations are harmful and can cause diseases or health problems, while others may have no noticeable effect, and a few mutations can even be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different types of genetic mutations. One common type is called a point mutation, where only one letter of the DNA sequence is changed. Another type is called a deletion or insertion mutation, where a small piece of DNA is either missing or added to the sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutations can occur in any part of our DNA, including the coding regions that provide instructions for making proteins, or in the non-coding regions that may play a role in gene regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, mutations can be inherited from our parents. These are called germline mutations and can be passed down from generation to generation. Other times, mutations can happen in our body's cells during our lifetime. These are called somatic mutations and are not passed on to our children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic mutations can have varying effects on our health. Some can cause genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. Others can increase the risk of developing certain diseases, such as cancer. However, it's important to note that not all mutations lead to disease or health issues. In fact, some mutations can even provide an advantage, such as resistance to certain infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists study genetic mutations to better understand how they occur and how they can impact our health. This knowledge can help in diagnosing and treating genetic disorders, as well as developing new therapies and medications. Overall, genetic mutations are a natural part of our genetic makeup and play a significant role in shaping who we are.\n",

      "Concept: Overfitting in Machine Learning\n",
      "Best Response: Overfitting is a concept in machine learning where a model fits the training data too well, to the point that it becomes overly specific to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the process of training a machine learning model, the goal is to find patterns and relationships in the training data that can be generalized to make accurate predictions on unseen data. However, if a model becomes too complex or flexible, it can start to memorize the specific examples in the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "This can happen when a model has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data, or when the model is trained for too many iterations. The result is that the model becomes overly sensitive to noise or random fluctuations in the training data, which are not representative of the true underlying patterns.\n",
      "\n",
      "When an overfit model is applied to new data, it tends to perform poorly because it has essentially \"memorized\" the training data and does not understand the underlying relationships. This phenomenon is called overfitting because the model has fit the training data too closely, losing its ability to generalize to new data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent overfitting, various techniques can be used, such as regularization, which adds a penalty term to the model's objective function to discourage excessive complexity, or cross-validation, which evaluates the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. By keeping the model's complexity in check and validating its performance on unseen data, overfitting can be mitigated, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions.\n",
      "------\n",
      "Worst Response: Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model becomes too specific and learns details from the training data that may not be generalizable to new, unseen data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Imagine you are trying to predict whether a fruit is an apple or an orange based on its size and color. If you train a model using an excessive amount of data that includes not only apples and oranges but also some rotten fruits or other unrelated objects, the model may start to learn too many unnecessary details from this noisy data. As a result, it might not be able to accurately predict whether a new fruit is an apple or an orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "In simple terms, overfitting is when a model is so focused on the specific examples it was trained on that it struggles to make accurate predictions on new, similar but unseen data. This is a problem because the purpose of machine learning is to build models that can generalize well to new situations, not just memorize the training data.\n",
