    "# Prompting Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is a piece of text that conveys to a LLM what the user wants. What the user wants can be many things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asking a question\n",
    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",
    "1. Task description: where you describe what you want\n",
    "2. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "3. Context information: background info on what you are requesting, the data you are providing etc...\n",
    "4. Prompt style: its how you ask the thing to the model and that can greatly influence its performance, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Prompts can also be seen as a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM.](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2302.11382#:~:text=prompts%20are%20also%20a%20form%20of%20programming%20that%20can%20customize%20the%20outputs%20and%20interactions%20with%20an%20llm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way I like to think about prompts, is as tools that rearrange the weights (probabilities) in the LLM text representation space, to allow you access to a particular sub-universe within the embedding space of the LLM. \n",

       "'The meaning of life is a profound question that has been contemplated by philosophers, theologians, and individuals throughout history. While there is no definitive answer that applies to everyone, the meaning of life can be subjective and unique to each individual.\\n\\nFor some, the meaning of life may be found in personal fulfillment and happiness, pursuing passions and goals, forming meaningful connections with others, or making a positive impact on the world. Others may find meaning through spiritual or religious beliefs, seeking enlightenment or a deeper understanding of existence.\\n\\nUltimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and introspective journey. It is about discovering what brings you joy, fulfillment, and purpose, and aligning your actions and values accordingly. It is important to remember that the meaning of life can evolve and change as we grow and experience different stages of life.'"

      "Concept: Genetic Mutations\n",
      "Best Response: Genetic mutations refer to changes or alterations in the DNA sequence of an organism's genes. The DNA in our cells contains all the instructions for the development, functioning, and traits of an organism. Mutations can occur spontaneously or can be caused by environmental factors such as radiation, chemicals, or errors during DNA replication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutations can have various effects on an organism. Some mutations are harmless and may not cause any noticeable changes. However, some mutations can have serious consequences. For example, they can disrupt the normal functioning of a gene, leading to the production of abnormal proteins or the absence of certain proteins. This can result in various genetic disorders or diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are different types of mutations, including point mutations, insertions, and deletions. Point mutations involve changes in a single nucleotide base of the DNA sequence. Insertions and deletions involve the addition or removal of one or more nucleotide bases. These changes can affect the reading frame and alter the amino acid sequence during protein synthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all mutations are detrimental. In fact, mutations can also be beneficial under certain circumstances. They can lead to new genetic variations that provide advantages to an organism in a changing environment or help it adapt to new conditions. These advantageous mutations can eventually become more common in a population through the process of natural selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, genetic mutations are changes in the DNA sequence that can have a range of effects, from no impact to causing genetic disorders. They are an essential part of genetic diversity and can contribute to the evolution of species.\n",
      "------\n",
      "Worst Response: Genetic mutations are changes that happen in our DNA, which is like an instruction manual for our bodies. Just like how a spelling mistake can change the meaning of a word, genetic mutations can change the instructions that our bodies follow. These mutations can happen in different ways, like a small change in a single letter of the DNA code, or even bigger changes like adding or removing a whole section of DNA. Sometimes these mutations can have no effect on our health, but other times they can cause diseases or other changes in our bodies.\n",
      "------\n",
      "**************************************************\n",
      "Concept: Utilitarianism\n",
      "Best Response: Utilitarianism is a philosophical theory that suggests that the moral value of an action is determined by its overall utility or usefulness in promoting happiness or minimizing suffering for the greatest number of people. The main idea behind utilitarianism is to maximize overall well-being or happiness for the majority of individuals in a given situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to utilitarianism, an action is considered morally right if it produces the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the most people. Conversely, an action is considered morally wrong if it leads to the greatest amount of suffering or pain for the most people. This concept is often summarized as the principle of \"the greatest happiness for the greatest number.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilitarianism also takes into consideration the consequences of an action rather than focusing solely on the intentions or motives behind it. It is a consequentialist ethical theory, meaning that it judges the morality of an action based on its outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilitarianism is further divided into two main types: act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism evaluates each individual action and determines its moral value based on the overall happiness it produces. Rule utilitarianism, on the other hand, focuses on creating rules or principles that, if universally followed, would lead to the greatest overall happiness for society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Critics argue that utilitarianism may overlook the rights and well-being of minority groups or individuals in certain situations, as it prioritizes majority happiness. It can also be challenging to accurately measure happiness and quantify the consequences of an action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, utilitarianism provides a framework for making ethical decisions based on the principle of maximizing overall happiness. It is often used as a guide in fields such as ethics, politics, and economics, where determining the best course of action for the greatest number of people is a key consideration.\n",
      "------\n",
      "Worst Response: Sure! Utilitarianism is a moral and ethical principle that focuses on maximizing overall happiness and minimizing overall suffering for the greatest number of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "The basic idea behind utilitarianism is that actions are morally right if they result in the greatest amount of overall happiness or pleasure for the majority of people affected by the action. Conversely, actions are morally wrong if they cause more suffering or pain for the majority of people affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utilitarianism takes into consideration the consequences of actions, rather than focusing on personal intentions or individual rights. This means that what matters most is the overall impact an action has on society, rather than the individual benefits or harms. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that utilitarianism prioritizes the collective good over individual happiness. This means that in some cases, it might require individuals to sacrifice their own interests or well-being for the greater benefit of society.\n",

      "Utilitarianism can be seen as a practical approach to making ethical decisions, as it aims to create the greatest amount of happiness and minimize harm for the largest number of people. However, it can also be subject to criticism, as it may overlook the rights or interests of minority groups or individuals in certain situations.\n",

      "Best Response: Overfitting in machine learning happens when a model is trained too well and starts to memorize the training data instead of learning the underlying pattern. It is like a student who memorizes answers to specific questions but doesn't understand the concepts behind them. \n",

      "To prevent overfitting, we need to simplify the model by reducing its complexity or limiting the amount of information it can memorize. This allows the model to focus on important patterns rather than getting lost in the details.\n",
