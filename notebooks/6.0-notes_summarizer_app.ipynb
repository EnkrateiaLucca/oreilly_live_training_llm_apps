He emphasizes the importance of understanding the potential of these media for serious explanations, rather than just popularization or education. Nielsen believes that non-traditional media can offer opportunities for explanations that are deeper than conventional verbal and symbolic explanations. He also explores the design of a tool for explaining scientific ideas using non-traditional media. Additionally, he touches on the concept of optimization and the goal of finding a set of weights that minimizes the loss function.'"
