Explain this concept in simple terms,"Genetic mutations are changes in the DNA code that can happen naturally or due to outside factors like radiation or chemicals. These changes can lead to differences in traits, such as eye color or disease risk. Some mutations are harmful, some have no effect, and a few can even be beneficial.

Explain this concept in simple terms,"Overfitting in machine learning happens when a model learns the specific details of the training data too well, to the point that it doesn't perform well with new, unseen data. It's like when a student memorizes the answers to a few specific questions for a test, but then struggles with similar questions they haven't seen before. In machine learning, overfitting can lead to poor predictions because the model is too focused on the training data and doesn't generalize well to new situations.","I would give this response a score of 90 out of 100.

Explain the following concept:,"Overfitting in machine learning occurs when a model learns to perform well on the training data but does not generalize well to new, unseen data. This happens when the model learns the specific patterns and noise in the training data, rather than the underlying relationships that would allow it to make accurate predictions on new data.
