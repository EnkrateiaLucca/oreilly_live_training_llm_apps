    "1 Introduction\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
    "in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
    "transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
    "efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
    "architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
    "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
    "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
    "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
    "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
    "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
    "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
    "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
    "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
    "the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
    "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
    "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
    "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
    "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
    "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
    "2 Background\n",
    "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
    "[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
    "block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
    "the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
    "in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
    "it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
    "reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
    "to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
    "described in section 3.2.\n",
    "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
    "of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",
    "used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\n",
    "textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
    "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\n",
    "language modeling tasks [34].\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\n",
    "entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
    "self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
    "3 Model Architecture\n",
    "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
    "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\n",
    "of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
    "sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
    "[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
    "2\n",
    "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n",
    "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
    "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
    "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
    "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
    "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
    "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
    "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
    "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
    "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
    "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
    "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
    "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
    "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
    "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
    "3.2 Attention\n",
    "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
    "where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",
    "3\n",
    "Scaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\n",
    "attention layers running in parallel.\n",
    "of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
    "query with the corresponding key.\n",
    "3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    "We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
    "queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",
    "query with all keys, divide each by √\n",
    "dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
    "values.\n",
    "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
    "into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\n",
    "the matrix of outputs as:\n",
    "Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\n",
    "√\n",
    "dk\n",
    ")V (1)\n",
    "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
    "of √\n",
    "1\n",
    "dk\n",
    ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",
    "a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\n",
    "much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\n",
    "matrix multiplication code.\n",
    "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
    "dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",
    "dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\n",
    "extremely small gradients 4\n",
    ". To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by √\n",
    "1\n",
    "dk\n",
    ".\n",
    "3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\n",
    "we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\n",
    "linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",
    "queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n",

    "subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n",
    "MultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)WO\n",

    "In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\n",
    "dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
    "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
    "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
    "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
    "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
    "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
    "[38, 2, 9].\n",
    "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
    "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
    "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    "encoder.\n",
    "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    "FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
    "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
    "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
    "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    "df f = 2048.\n",
    "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    "our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
    "linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √\n",
    "dmodel.\n",
    "5\n",
    "Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\n",
    "for different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\n",

    "Self-Attention (restricted) O(r · n · d) O(1) O(n/r)\n",
    "3.5 Positional Encoding\n",
    "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    "order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    "tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    "bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
    "as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",
    "learned and fixed [9].\n",
    "In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "P E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    "P E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    "where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    "corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
    "chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    "relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    "P Epos.\n",
    "We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
    "versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    "because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    "during training.\n",
    "4 Why Self-Attention\n",
    "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
    "(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi\n",
    ", zi ∈ R\n",
    "d\n",
    ", such as a hidden\n",
    "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    "consider three desiderata.\n",
    "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    "different layer types.\n",
    "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    "6\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    "[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d\n",
    "2\n",
    "). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    "the approach we take in our model.\n",
    "As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
    "from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
    "heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n",
    "and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",
    "5 Training\n",
    "This section describes the training regime for our models.\n",
    "5.1 Training Data and Batching\n",
    "We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\n",
    "sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n",
    "2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\n",
    "vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\n",
    "batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\n",
    "target tokens.\n",
    "5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n",
    "We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\n",
    "the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\n",
    "trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\n",

    "In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on\n",
    "attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\n",
    "multi-headed self-attention.\n",
    "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\n",
    "on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\n",
    "English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\n",
    "model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
    "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
    "plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
    "to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\n",
    "such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",

      "Strategy 2 - Provide Reference Text:\n",
      " 1. Positional Encoding Intuitively:\n",
      "Positional encoding in the Transformer architecture serves as a mechanism to provide the model with the sequential order information of the input tokens, which is crucial for understanding the structured nature of language. Since the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism treats input elements independently without considering their positions in the sequence, it inherently lacks the means to capture the order of tokens, which is vital for comprehending many linguistic constructs. \n",
      "\n",
      "To address this, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings, ensuring that the position information is available to the model right from the start. The use of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies as positional encodings is particularly insightful because it provides a unique positional signal for each token while also enabling the model to understand relative positions. The choice of these functions allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, as the positional encoding for any given position can be represented as a linear function of the encodings of other positions. This property is beneficial for tasks involving sequences where the relative positioning of elements significantly impacts their interpretation, such as in language understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Understanding Context in Long Sentences through Self-Attention:\n",
      "Self-attention, a key innovation in the Transformer architecture, enables the model to efficiently handle long-range dependencies within a sentence. Unlike traditional recurrent or convolutional layers that process sequences step-by-step or within local neighborhoods, self-attention allows each token in the input sequence to directly attend to every other token. This is accomplished by computing the attention weights that reflect the relevance or contribution of all other tokens with respect to a given token.\n",
      "\n",
      "This mechanism provides a couple of significant advantages for understanding context in long sentences:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Direct Modeling of Relationships**: Self-attention directly models the relationships between all pairs of tokens in a sentence, regardless of their distance in the sequence. This capability is crucial for understanding the context, as it allows the model to capture dependencies between distant tokens without the information needing to traverse through many intermediate steps, as in recurrent networks. Consequently, it effectively deals with long-range dependencies that are common in natural language, enhancing the model's ability to understand the overall context of long sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Parallel Processing**: Self-attention enables parallel processing of all token pairs, making the model computationally efficient, especially for long sentences. This efficiency arises because the computation of attention weights for all pairs occurs simultaneously, instead of sequentially. The ability to handle all parts of the sentence concurrently improves the model’s understanding of context, as it can consider the entire sentence's information at once, rather than piecemeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, self-attention gives the Transformer the remarkable ability to directly and efficiently capture the complex interdependencies between tokens in long sentences, leading to a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the context.\n"

    "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",

    "3.2 Attention\n",
    "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",

    "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",

    "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    "encoder.\n",
    "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    "FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",

    "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    "df f = 2048.\n",
    "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",

    "4 Why Self-Attention\n",
    "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
    "(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi\n",
    ", zi ∈ R\n",
    "d\n",
    ", such as a hidden\n",
    "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    "consider three desiderata.\n",
    "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    "different layer types.\n",
    "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    "6\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    "[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d\n",
    "2\n",
    "). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    "the approach we take in our model.\n",
    "As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
    "from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
    "heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n",

    "attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\n",
    "multi-headed self-attention.\n",
    "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based\n",
    "on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\n",
    "English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\n",
    "model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
    "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
    "plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
    "to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\n",
    "such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",

It highlights the challenges with recurrent models and emphasizes the benefits of attention mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies efficiently. The Transformer model's structure, training process, and impressive results in machine translation, as well as in English constituency parsing, are detailed in the paper. The conclusion discusses the potential applications of attention-based models beyond text translation tasks and provides insights into future research directions. Visualizations of attention heads in the Transformer model demonstrate its ability to capture complex dependencies within sequences.\n"
