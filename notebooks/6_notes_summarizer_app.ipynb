John Doe gave an overview of the project, explaining that the goal is to develop a new AI model that will significantly improve our product's capabilities. The estimated timeline for the project is 18 months, but John stressed that this is a rough estimate and will likely be refined as we delve deeper into the project.\n",

    "Michael Brown, our lead developer, gave a technical overview of how we might approach the development of the AI model. He proposed a two-stage process: an initial exploratory phase to investigate different methods, followed by a focused development phase where we will construct and fine-tune the final model. \n",

Michael will begin setting up a sandbox for the development team to use during the exploratory phase.
