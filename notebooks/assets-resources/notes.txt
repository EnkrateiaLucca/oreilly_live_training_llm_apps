Title: Project Launch Meeting

Date: July 23, 2023

Attendees: John Doe, Jane Smith, Michael Brown, Lisa Johnson

Summary: 

Today we held the kickoff meeting for our new project, CodeName X. The team is very excited to get started. John Doe gave an overview of the project, explaining that the goal is to develop a new AI model that will significantly improve our product's capabilities. The estimated timeline for the project is 18 months, but John stressed that this is a rough estimate and will likely be refined as we delve deeper into the project.

Jane Smith spoke about the resources we have at our disposal, including a robust development team and state-of-the-art AI training facilities. She also mentioned the possibility of bringing in some external consultants for specific tasks, which was met with approval from the rest of the team.

Michael Brown, our lead developer, gave a technical overview of how we might approach the development of the AI model. He proposed a two-stage process: an initial exploratory phase to investigate different methods, followed by a focused development phase where we will construct and fine-tune the final model. 

Lisa Johnson talked about project management and highlighted the importance of maintaining good communication throughout the project. She suggested using Agile methodology to manage the project, which the team agreed upon.

Next Steps:

John will send out a project brief by the end of this week. Jane will look into potential consultants we might want to bring on board. Michael will begin setting up a sandbox for the development team to use during the exploratory phase. Lisa will set up the project in our project management tool and will schedule a project planning meeting for next week.
