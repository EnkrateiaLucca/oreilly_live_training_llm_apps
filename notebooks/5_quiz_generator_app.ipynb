       "Answers:\n",
       "1. A list and a tuple are both data structures in Python, but they have some differences. \n",
       "   - A list is mutable, which means its elements can be modified after it is created. On the other hand, a tuple is immutable, meaning its elements cannot be changed once it is created.\n",
       "   - Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses ().\n",
       "   - Lists are typically used for storing collections of similar items, while tuples are often used for grouping related data together.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Inheritance is a key concept in object-oriented programming, including Python. It allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, known as the parent or base class. The class that inherits from the parent class is called the child or derived class.\n",
       "\n",
       "   In Python, inheritance is implemented using the syntax:\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "   class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
       "       # Child class definition\n",
       "   ```\n",
       "\n",
       "   The child class can access and use the attributes and methods of the parent class, and it can also override or extend them as needed. This allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes."
