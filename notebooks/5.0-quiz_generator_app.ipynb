       "1. What are Python decorators, and how are they used in a Python program?\n",

       "\n",
       "### Answers:\n",
       "1. Python decorators are a powerful tool that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class. They are functions that take another function as an argument and extend or alter its behavior without explicitly modifying it. Decorators are often used for logging, access control, instrumentation, and caching. They are applied using the `@decorator_name` syntax above the function definition.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. List comprehensions in Python provide a concise way to create lists. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, and then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the `for` and `if` clauses that follow it. For example, `[x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]` creates a list of squares of even numbers from 0 to 9."
